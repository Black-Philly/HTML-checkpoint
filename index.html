   <section><h1>How we rank our Used Cars</h1>
    <p>Our used car rankings are based on the consensus opinion of America's top automotive experts, as well as
         reliability, safety and total cost of ownership data from third-party providers. The rankings do not 
         rely on our own tests or U.S. News editors' preferences.</p>
    <p>We rank used cars based on an overall score that combines the component scores listed below in a 
        weighted-average formula. Weights are derived from the results of a used car shopping survey 
        performed by U.S. News.</p>
    <p>The components and their weights are as follows:
        <ul>
        <li>Critics’ Opinions: 22%</li>
        <li>Performance: 11%</li>
        <li>Interior: 11%</li>
        <li>Total Cost of Ownership: 19%</li>
        <li>Safety: 17%</li>
        <li>Reliability: 20%</li>
    </ul>
       <p>In cases where a component score is unavailable, we use a previous model year’s score, if available.</p>

        <h1>How We Calculate Component Scores</h1>

       <h2><i>Analysis of Expert Reviews</i></h2>
       
       <p>For each used car in the U.S. News rankings, our editors analyze credible reviews of the car to 
        come up with a score representing what professional critics said about it when it was new. The reviews were 
        gathered from major newspapers, magazines and automotive websites. For each third-party review, 
        we score the car on three different components.</p>
    
        <p><ol>
            <li>Performance: The performance score represents the reviewer's written assessment of a car's handling, 
        braking, acceleration, ride quality and other qualitative performance measures.</li>
       <li> Interior: The interior score represents the reviewer's written assessment of the car's interior comfort,
         features, cargo space, styling and build quality.</li>
        <li>Critic’s Opinion: The score represents the overall tone and how strongly the reviewer recommends the car.
        Cars that won major automotive industry awards in a particular model year, such as Motor Trend Car of 
        the Year and North American Car of the Year, receive an increase in their Critic’s Opinion score to 
        reflect the particularly strong recommendation the awarding publication or group gives to the winners.</li>
